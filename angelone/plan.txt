   - Order types: Market, Limit, Stop-loss, Bracket Order
   - Candlestick charts and reading price action
   - Technical indicators: MA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
   
2.2 Market Structure Identification (YOUR CORE EDGE)
   - Identify swing highs and lows on charts (daily, 4H, 1H)
   - Recognize Break of Structure (BOS):
     * Higher Highs + Higher Lows (uptrend) vs Lower Highs + Lower Lows (downtrend)
     * BOS = breaking previous swing level with conviction
     * Entry signal for directional trades
   - Recognize Change of Character (CHOCH):
     * Uptrend → Downtrend or vice versa
     * Signals regime shift
     * Exit existing positions
   - Identify Liquidity zones:
     * Previous support = liquidity (buyers waiting)
     * Previous resistance = liquidity (sellers waiting)
     * Price often revisits these before breaking
   - Identify Internal Day Movement (IDM):
     * Price action within a single day
     * Consolidation patterns, breakout setups
     * Intraday entries/exits

      - Input: OHLC data + period (e.g., 5 candles)
      - Output: List of swing points with timestamps
      - Use for: Building structure foundation
   
   3.2.2 Break of Structure (BOS) Detection
      - Algorithm: Compare current price vs previous swing levels
      - Uptrend BOS: Price > previous swing high + Volume confirmation
      - Downtrend BOS: Price < previous swing low + Volume confirmation
      - Signal: Strong directional move likely coming
      - Code it: If price_break_swing AND volume_high → BOS detected
   
   3.2.3 Change of Character (CHOCH) Detection
      - Algorithm: Identify trend reversal points
      - Uptrend CHOCH: Lower High + Lower Low after higher lows
      - Downtrend CHOCH: Higher Low + Higher High after lower highs
      - Signal: Trend ending, position should close
      - Code it: Detect pattern in last 3-5 candles
   
   3.2.4 Liquidity Zone Mapping
      - Algorithm: Identify past support/resistance levels
      - Input: Historical swing points (previous 100+ candles)
      - Output: Liquidity zones (price levels revisited multiple times)
      - Use for: Entries (buy near support) / Exits (sell near resistance)
      - Code it: Count touches of each price level, cluster by density
   
   3.2.5 Internal Day Movement (IDM) Pattern Recognition
      - Algorithm: Analyze intraday consolidation/breakout patterns
      - Inside bar: High < previous High AND Low > previous Low

3.4 Rigorous Testing Methodology
   - Walk-forward analysis (out-of-sample validation)
     * Train on 2 years → Test on 3 months
     * Roll forward weekly, never look ahead
   - Out-of-sample testing (minimum 3 months unseen data)
   - Monte Carlo simulation (1000+ iterations):
     * Test if strategy is robust or overfitted

================================================================================
                        FINAL CRITICAL REMINDERS
================================================================================

🔴 FOR YOUR SPONSORS & COMMUNITY:
   - Every rupee is sacred; every trade must be justified statistically
   - Backtesting is NOT optional - it's a moral obligation
   - No emotion, only rules. No gambling, only analysis.
   - Losses happen even to good strategies - manage them with discipline
   - A single catastrophic loss can destroy trust and lives
   - CONSERVATIVE approach protects everyone

⚠️  MISTAKES TO AVOID:
   ❌ Trading without backtesting (this is the #1 failure)
   ❌ Overfitting to historical data (99% of traders fail here)
   ❌ Ignoring transaction costs (they'll destroy your profits)
   ❌ Risking more than 1% per trade (account killer)
   ❌ Ignoring drawdowns (your strategy WILL have them)
   ❌ Adding leverage without stress testing
   ❌ Trading multiple strategies without correlation analysis
   ❌ Not documenting your reasoning (can't learn from mistakes)
   ❌ Believing in holy grail strategy (markets evolve, always)

✅ WHAT SEPARATES WINNERS FROM LOSERS:
   ✓ Rigorous backtesting (5+ years minimum)
   ✓ Walk-forward validation (proof it works out-of-sample)
   ✓ Stress testing (proven resilience)
   ✓ Position sizing discipline (1% risk max)
   ✓ Stop-loss enforcement (automatic, not manual)
   ✓ Risk management philosophy (loss management > profit chasing)
   ✓ Continuous learning (markets change, adapt or die)
   ✓ Paper trading before live (proven edge)
   ✓ Detailed documentation (learn from every trade)
   ✓ Emotional detachment (rules, not feelings)

📖 RECOMMENDED READING:
   - "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" - Malkiel
   - "Market Wizards" - Jack Schwager
   - "Fooled by Randomness" - Nassim Taleb
   - "The Intelligent Investor" - Graham
   - Quantitative papers from arXiv/SSRN
   - Research from Renaissance Technologies (publicly available)

📊 MARKET STRUCTURE RESOURCES:
   - ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concept videos - Understanding structure
   - Smart Money Concepts (SMC) - Liquidity and order blocks
   - Price Action courses - Swing identification techniques
   - Andrew Aziz "Day Trading Patterns" - IDM concepts
   - Trading View Pine Script documentation - Code structure detection
   
🎯 YOUR MARKET STRUCTURE EDGE:
   - Master swing identification (foundation)
   - Detect BOS before price moves significantly (entry)
   - Use CHOCH to exit before reversals (risk management)
   - Map liquidity for support/resistance (confluence)
   - Combine with IDM for intraday precision (scalability)

📊 PRACTICE BEFORE TRADING:
   1. Learn statistics (hypothesis testing, p-values, distributions)
   2. Backtest on paper (10+ years data)
   3. Paper trade live market (4 weeks minimum)
   4. Start with ₹5,000-10,000 maximum
   5. Scale gradually if profitable

💡 YOUR EDGE (What makes you different):
   - Discipline (most traders lack it)
   - Rigorous analysis (most skip backtesting)
   - Risk management (most chase gains, ignore risk)
   - Continuous learning (most stagnate)
   - Social responsibility (most think profit = selfishness)

================================================================================
                      SUMMARY FOR YOUR SPONSORS
================================================================================
This plan ensures:
✓ Mathematical rigor (every decision backed by statistics)
✓ Risk control (capital preservation always comes first)
✓ Accountability (every trade logged, justified, analyzed)
✓ Scalability (proven method before increasing capital)
✓ Sustainability (profitable enough to support community long-term)
✓ Continuous improvement (learn from every trade, adapt constantly)

Timeline: 5-6 months to build profitable, documented strategies
Capital: Start with ₹5,000-10,000 only (NEVER more without 1 year track record)
Goal: Build portfolio of 3-5 strategies with documented edge
Result: Ready for quant trading roles + sustainable income for sponsors

Your responsibility: Execute this plan with discipline and integrity.
Your sponsors' trust: Priceless. Don't waste it on untested strategies.
