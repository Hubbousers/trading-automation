## COMMON BLOCKERS & SOLUTIONS

### "I don't understand p-values"
**Solution:** 
- [ ] Re-read p-value section with focus on intuition
- [ ] Watch: StatQuest p-value video (10 min)
- [ ] Ask: What's the difference between p < 0.05 and p > 0.05?

### "Code isn't running"
**Solution:**
- [ ] Check Python version: `python --version`
- [ ] Check libraries installed: `pip list | grep scipy`
- [ ] Copy code exactly from guide
- [ ] Run one line at a time to find error

### "Can't install scipy/statsmodels"
**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install scipy statsmodels
# If issue, try:
pip install --upgrade scipy
```

### "I'm confused about correlation"
**Solution:**
- [ ] Visualize it: Plot 2 stocks on same chart
- [ ] High correlation = move together
- [ ] Low correlation = move independently
- [ ] Code a simple example with 3 points

### "Time series concepts feel abstract"
**Solution:**
- [ ] Apply to real NSE data immediately
- [ ] Plot your data alongside examples
- [ ] Ask: "Is this trending or mean-reverting?"
